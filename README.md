# 3D Microstructure and Properties of Crystalline Materials

## Purpose
This repository contains a series of LaTeX files and associated figures needed to create an open source guide to 3D Microstructure and Properties analysis, with an emphasis on their importance in the Texture Analysis field.  This is a living document and sections will be added on a regular basis.  Feel free to contact me directly if you wish to contribute. 

## Generating the PDF file
You can generate the main.pdf document if you have a fully functional LaTeX installation.  First, clone the repo to some location on your hard drive using

*git clone ssh://github.com/microprops/microprops*

Then typeset the main.tex file using the standard LaTeX sequence: LaTeX-BibTeX-LaTeX-LaTeX.  That should do it.
