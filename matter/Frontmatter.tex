%\section*{What is in this book?}
%We begin this book with rotations in 2D; this will serve as a review as well as an opportunity to define several important concepts, including \textit{active} and \textit{passive} rotations, \textit{positive} and \textit{negative} rotation angles, and so on.  Then we cover 3D rotations in section~\ref{sec:3Drotations} using only rotation matrices; we will introduce the concept of a special orthonormal matrix and the related space of 3D orientations, $SO(3)$.  Euler angles form the topic of section~\ref{sec:eulerangles}; we will introduce the Bunge convention in detail, and also discuss other conventions.  Neo-Eulerian representations are introduced in section~\ref{sec:neoEulerian}; they include the \textit{axis-angle pair}, the \textit{quaternion}, the \textit{Rodrigues-Frank vector}, the \textit{homochoric vector}, and the \textit{stereographic vector}.  Section~\ref{sec:cubochoric} is devoted to the recently introduced \textit{cubochoric} representation.

%The text is heavily illustrated and makes use of numerous examples and exercises.
